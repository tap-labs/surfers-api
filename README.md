# Surfers Lookout API

Writing this as want to create a Surf report web site, including Live CAMs without all the bloat and privacy issues in the commercial crop dominating the internet. This has been motiviated by the fact that all local sites here in Sydney now have enforced a charge model for what is typically low quality reporting with CAM feeds from public cameras.

## Current features
- Map based navigation
- location search bar with autocomplete
- surf cams 
- Persistence via MySQL or sqlite
- Support for k8s service binding
- Weather alert ticker from BOM RSS feeds
- Spot based current weather forecast from BOM API

## Being worked on
- Site specific information  to add **(done this kind of with willyweather widgets but needs to be better)**
    - Weather
    - Tide

## To Do
- Add authentication to bring user context to the app
- Add chat forum, location aligned (and general chat?)
